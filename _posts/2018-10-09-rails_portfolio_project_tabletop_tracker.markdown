I play strategic tabletop games at least once a week, including some of my favorites: Scythe, Dominion, Terraforming Mars, Agricola and of course the classics like Settlers of Catan. [This project](https://github.com/aellonk/tabletoptracker) tracks tabletop gaming data and would definitely make Parks and Rec's Ben Wyatt proud.

A simple reminder that goes a long way - utilize all of your resources, and if you still can't figure something out, take a break and go back to it later. After digging deep in Stack Overflow and trying to troubleshoot for a while, don't be afraid to ask for help. I began this project emailing with the project lead to make sure my models would work the way I envisioned for this app. A diagram allowed me to visualize the relationships between the models and eased the discussion via email.

The project's [spec.md](https://github.com/learn-co-students/rails-assessment-v-000/blob/master/spec.md) file lists all of the requirements, but I also made a personalized to-do list with the steps needed to fulfill them, which helped me stay on track and cross off small victories. I went to study groups, and had three [1:1 meetings](https://theflatironschool.typeform.com/to/B9BrgH) with technical coaches for project support. If you are in Flatiron School's Online Web Developer program I highly recommend scheduling at least one. Having another pair of eyes on the project helped me realize I was missing a few important things, such as a Readme in the repository. It's like a mock assessment before the real deal and can be extremely helpful.

I'm excited to build upon this project in the future to share with friends and hopefully one day at [Pax Unplugged](http://unplugged.paxsite.com/)!
