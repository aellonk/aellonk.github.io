A little over a year ago, I started learning to code after a close friend introduced me to HTML & CSS. It quickly turned from just a hobby into a passion and career objective after realizing how much I enjoyed it. I like to build things, and coding is an excellent outlet for that. I also love that it calls for strategic and creative problem solving. Now whenever I’m not nannying I’m most likely learning, practicing, or creating something with code. I have already developed a handful of websites so far, and this is only the beginning.

Coding languages are constantly evolving and I want to be on the forefront of emerging technologies. I will always be learning to code bigger and better things, and I’m excited to push boundaries in web development.

I am forever grateful for all of the free online tutorials that make learning to code so accessible to anyone with an internet connection. After learning on my own for some time now, I could really benefit from a mentor and a structured curriculum to fill the gaps in my knowledge. That’s where the highly esteemed Flatiron School comes in. I’ve been awarded a Women Take Tech scholarship from Birchbox to enroll in Flatiron School’s Online Web Developer program. With the help of this program I hope to become employed as a full stack web developer. This is Day 1 and I’m excited to take my education to the next level!
